# Chapter 8 - Federation services

This example demonstrates the integration of [Apollo Federation services](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/implementing-services/) into a stitched schema, as described in [Federation services documentation](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/stitch-type-merging#federation-services).

As you get the hang of Schema Stitching, you may realize just how complex Federation services are for what they do. The `buildFederatedSchema` method from the `@apollo/federation` package creates a fairly nuanced GraphQL resource that does not guarentee itself to be independently consistent or valid, but plugs seamlessly into a greater automation package. By comparison, stitching encourages services to be independently valid and self-contained GraphQL resources, which makes them quite primitive and durable. While federation automates service bindings at the cost of tightly-coupled complexity, stitching sticks to loosely-coupled bindings at the cost of manual configuration. The merits of each strategy are likely a deciding factor when selecting a platform. In a very real sense, Stitching is a library that may be used to build a framework such as Federation.

In general, stitching works better without the overhead complexity added by `buildFederatedSchema`. However, when integrating with preexisting servers or in the process of a migration, nothing says you can't incorporate your existing federation resources into a stitched gateway.

**This example demonstrates:**

- Integrating Apollo Federation services into a stitched schema.
- Fetching and parsing Federation SDLs.

## Setup

```shell
cd federation-services

yarn install
yarn start-services
```

Then in a new terminal tab:

```shell
yarn start-gateway
```

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** http://localhost:4000/graphql
- _Products subservice_: http://localhost:4001/graphql
- _Reviews subservice_: http://localhost:4002/graphql
- _Users subservice_: http://localhost:4003/graphql

This example is based on the [Federation intro example](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/#concern-based-separation).

## Summary

Ever wonder what Federation is doing under the hood? Visit the [products service](http://localhost:4001/graphql) and check out some `User` objects:

```graphql
query {
  _entities(representations: [
    { __typename: "User", id: "1" },
    { __typename: "User", id: "2" },
    { __typename: "User", id: "3" }
  ]) {
    ...on User {
      id
      recentPurchases {
        upc
        name
        price
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A Federation service automatically builds an `_entities` query that recieves typed keys (i.e.: objects with a `__typename`), and returns abstract `_Entity` objects that may assume the shape of any type in the service. [Apollo Gateway](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/gateway) then automates the exchange of typed keys for typed results, all going through the dedicated protocol in each subservice. Schema Stitching can also integrate with this `_entities` query by sending it properly formatted keys.

Now [go to the gateway](http://localhost:4001/graphql) and check out the stitched results:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    username
    recentPurchases {
      upc
      name
    }
    reviews {
      body
      author {
        id
        username
      }
      product {
        upc
        name
        acceptsNewReviews
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The stitched gateway has loaded all federation SDLs, adapted their directives into stitching-native configuration, and now integrates them just like any other GraphQL service with type merging run through their `_entities` query.

### Adapting Federation services

All told, Federation and Stitching use very similar patterns to combine underlying subservices (both tools have shared origins in [Apollo Stitching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/migrating-from-stitching/) of old). However, their specific implementations vary slightly, the key differentiators being that:

- Apollo Federation uses a _centralized_ approach, where all types have a single "origin" service (this origin is where the unextended type definition is). Querying for a type always starts from its origin and builds out to its extensions.
- Stitching uses a _decentralized_ approach, where any service may originate any type. Regardless of where a type originates, its original representation may be filled in with missing details from any service.

The practical implication of how each tool handles origins informs how a federation service get translated into a stitched service:

- All types with a `@key` directive become merged types; the key fields go into `selectionSet`.
- All fields with a `@requires` directive are made into computed fields.
- All fields with an `@external` directive are removed _unless they are part of the `@key`_. Stitching expects schemas to only publish fields that they actually provide data for.
- With the indirection of `@external` fields eliminated, the `@provides` directive is no longer necessary. Stitching's query planner can automate the optimial selection of as many fields as possible from as few services as possible.
