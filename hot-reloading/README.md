# Example 6 â€“ Hot reloading with stitching directives

This example demonstrates the use of stitching directives to specify type merging configuration. Moving service-specific configuration out of the gateway facilitates service setup automation, facilitating hot-reloading.

The `@graphql-tools/stitching-directives` package provides importable directives that can be used to annotate types and fields within subschemas, a validator to ensure the directives are used appropriately, and a configuration transformer that can be used on the gateway to convert the subschema directives into explicit configuration setting.

The gateway server can refresh the schema in response to "push" input of service changes via mutations as well as "pull" input of service health via subschema SDL polling.

Note: the service setup in this example is based on the [official demonstration repository](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-demo) for
[Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).

**This example demonstrates:**

- Adding remote schemas, with typedefs and custom directives exposed via a custom root field.
- Use of the @key, @computed and @merge directives to specify type merging configuration.
- Use of a custom executor that times out a request after a pre-specified limit.
- Addition of custom queries/mutations on the gateway for listing/modifying the configured services.
- Hot reloading of the gateway schema based on "push" input of service changes and "pull" input of service health.

## Setup

```shell
cd 06-hot-reloading-with-directives.

yarn install
start-service-accounts
```

Then, in a separate terminal tab:

```shell
start-service-inventory
```

In a third terminal tab:

```shell
start-service-products
```

In a fourth terminal tab:

```shell
start-service-reviews
```

And, finally, in a fifth terminal tab:

```shell
yarn start-gateway
```

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** http://localhost:4000/graphql
- _Accounts subservice_: http://localhost:4001/graphql
- _Inventory subservice_: http://localhost:4002/graphql
- _Products subservice_: http://localhost:4003/graphql
- _Reviews subservice_: http://localhost:4004/graphql

## Summary

Visit the [stitched gateway](http://localhost:4000/graphql) and try running the following query:

```graphql
query {
  allEndpoints {
    url
  }
}
```

Note that the available types and root fields reflect all four of the services returned.

Then, try the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  removeEndpoint(url: "http://localhost:4004/graphql") {
    success
  }
}
```

Reload the [stitched gateway](http://localhost:4000/graphql) and see how the available types and root fields automatically adjust after the Reviews service has been removed from the gateway.

Then, try the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  addEndpoint(url: "http://localhost:4004/graphql") {
    success
  }
}
```

Reload the [stitched gateway](http://localhost:4000/graphql) and see how the available types and root fields have been restored.

Finally, try stopping the Review service by closing its terminal. Reload the [stitched gateway](http://localhost:4000/graphql) to once again see how the available types and root fields adjust automatically.
